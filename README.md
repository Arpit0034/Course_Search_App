üöÄ Launch Elasticsearch
	To start Elasticsearch locally:

	1. Open terminal and navigate to the Elasticsearch Docker directory: cd elasticsearch/docker-compose
	2. Run Elasticsearch using Docker Compose: docker-compose up -d
	
	Verify that Elasticsearch is running:

	1. curl http://localhost:9200
	
	You should receive a JSON response confirming Elasticsearch is running on localhost:9200.

üß± Build and Run Spring Boot Application
	
	Generate a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer or include the following dependencies manually:

	1. Spring Web (for REST controllers)
	2. Spring Data Elasticsearch (or official Elasticsearch client)
	3. Lombok (to reduce boilerplate code)
	4. ModelMapper (for mapping between entities and DTOs)

	Steps to Build and Run

	Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory: cd courseapp/courseapp

	Build the application: ./mvnw clean package

	Run the application: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

‚öôÔ∏è Application Configuration
	Add the following property inside application.properties (located in src/main/resources) to configure Elasticsearch connection: 	spring.elasticsearch.uris=http://localhost:9200

üì¶ Index Sample Data

	The application automatically reads a JSON file (sample-courses.json) containing 50+ course objects and indexes them into Elasticsearch upon startup.

	Trigger: Simply run the Spring Boot application.

	Verify: Open browser or use curl: curl http://localhost:9200/courses/_search?pretty

üîç Testing & Verification of Search Controller

     The application exposes a search API at: GET /api/search

     Query Parameters
     Parameter:	              Description: 
```
  1. q	                      Keyword for full-text search (title, description)
  2. minAge/maxAge	      Filter by age range
  3. category	              Filter by course category (e.g., Math, Science)
  4. type	              Filter by type: ONE_TIME, COURSE, CLUB
  5. minPrice/maxPrice	      Filter by price range
  6. startDate	              Show courses on/after this date (ISO-8601 format)
  7. sort                     Sort by: upcoming (default), priceAsc, priceDesc
